## Skills

- Knowledge of one of the following: GPU, CPU, Machine Learning, or System architecture
- Knowledge of design techniques for low power
- Familiarity with a hardware description language, such as VHDL or Verilog/SystemVerilog
- Exposure to verification techniques and testbenches (e.g. UVM and Formal)
- Programming languages such as: assembly language (ideally Arm assembler), higher-level (e.g. C), object-oriented (e.g. C++)
- Use of a UNIX environment and shell programming/scripting in e.g. Tcl, Perl, Python etc.
- Exposure to low-level programming or driver development
- A keen interest in processors and digital systems
- Understanding of computer architecture fundamentals
- Basic understanding of modern computer architecture. Familiarity with Arm (or x86) architecture or micro-architecture.
- Proven experience in Embedded Software or boot code/firmware development or low level operating systems drivers for processor architecture.
- Good understanding of different verification or software environments and  toolchains (specifically GNU toolchains)
- Expertise in at least one programming language (C or C++), one scripting language (Perl or Python) and assembly level programming.
- Experience in writing test code written in assembly, C, HVL and higher abstraction languages



## Steps
1) Get Electronics Engg. syllabus. Start from basic electronics,semiconductor/transistors/, move on to digital electronics followed by computer architecture, OS, micro controllers-8051 (which is taught in college ), device communication protocols( i2c,spi,uart,-very very imp),RTOS ..

2) By now you will be all set  for hands on with development board. I would suggest you to start with Arduino. Being in IT field you can do miracles !! and you will rock in coding.

3) Take a small project. Need not be too expensive (considering penny and time). Work on it . Solve bugs and attain perfection.

4) Voila!! Do multiple projects. Now you can bring ideas to products and you will be one man army(from embedded to software)!!!! Build quality products and keep contributing to tech!!
